# workin-9-5
A calendar application for a typical 9 am to 5 pm working day.

## Description
- The motivation for this project was to create a simple calendar application that allows users to save tasks and/or events for each hour of a typical working day. 
- Additionally, I always use planners and I will utilize this application quite often, finding it especially useful since it runs in the browser, and eliminates the need for a physical planner. 
- The date and time is displayed at the top of the application and the different colors, representing different periods of time, make it easy to keep track of time and tasks/events. 
- A green color block represents the future, red indicates the present and greay represents the past. 
- Initially there were multiple challenges faced, especially with JavaScript to implement the date and time, moving color time blocks and local storage. The local storage is still not functioning. As well, consolidating the code was difficult. 
- There have also been many challenges with time, including code being very time-consuming to write, and completing this project.
- This project runs in the browser using dynamically updated HTML and CSS and is powered by JQuery. 

## Usage
- To use this application all that is needed is a browser and an internet connection. Once the URL is placed in the browser the webpage will open.
- The user will input text into a time slot and click file image to save their task and/or event. 
- No authentications are needed to access the webpage.
