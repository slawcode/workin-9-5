# workin-9-5
A calendar application for a typical 9 am to 5 pm working day.

## Description
- The motivation for this project was to create a simple calendar application that allows users to save tasks and/or events for each hour of a typical working day. 
- Additionally, I always use planners and I will utilize this application quite often, finding it especially useful since it runs in the browser. 
- The date and time is displayed at the top of the application and the different colors, representing different periods of time, make it easy to keep track of time and tasks/events. 
- A green color block represents the future, red indicates the present and greay represents the past. 
- Initially there were multiple challenges faced, especially with JavaScript to implement the date and time, moving color time blocks and local storage. As well, consolidating the code was difficult. 
- There were also challenges with time and completing this project.
- This project runs in the browser using dynamically updated HTML and CSS and is powered by JQuery.
